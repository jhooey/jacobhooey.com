		<h2>The Structural Collapse of the World Trade Center</h2>
		<p>	
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A structural analysis of the 
			World Trade Center (WTC) towers shows that a collapse was inevitable 
			once the aircrafts impact occurred. It was only a redundancy in 
			design that allowed the tower to remain standing for an additional 
			1 hour and 43 minutes. The collapse itself occurred due to a 
			multitude of different structural failures, but it was the buckling 
			of the core that finally caused the tower to collapse.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structures reaction to the 
			initial impact was impressive. "Following the impact, floor loads 
			originally supported by the exterior columns in compression were 
			successfully transferred to other load paths" (FEMA 2-16). This 
			transfer of loads was made possible by the redundancy built into 
			the WTC, the major components in the structural system were 
			"composed of the exterior load-bearing frame, the gravity 
			load-bearing frame at the central core, and the system of deep 
			outrigger trusses in upper stories" (FEMA 2-16). Ultimately, when 
			the floors collapsed losing their support from the exterior walls, 
			and when a number of exterior columns collapsed "the structure was 
			able to successfully redistribute the building weight to the 
			remaining elements and to maintain a stable condition" (FEMA 2-21). 
			This redistribution of the loadings was made possible because the 
			remaining exterior columns had "substantial over-strength for 
			gravity loads" (FEMA 2-20). The largest piece of evidence proving 
			that the structure of the WTC was capable of redistributing all of 
			those loads as well as support the excess weight brought in by the 
			plane was the fact that it was able to remain standing "for 1 hour 
			and 43 minutes following the impact" (FEMA 2-21). From an 
			engineering perspective, the "impact damage to the core structure 
			had a negligible effect on the critical thermal load required to 
			initiate collapse in the core structure" (Irfanoglu and Hoffmann 66), 
			therefore a further study of the fire damage in the WTC needs to be made.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the investigation in the 
			collapse of the towers it was "estimated that a core collapse 
			mechanism could have been initiated in WTC-I if the tower-core 
			column temperatures were elevated to approximately 700&deg;C" (Irfanoglu 
			and Hoffmann 66). This estimation could be a good explanation as to 
			why the tower eventually collapsed and therefore should be 
			investigated further. It has been scientifically proven "that steel 
			begins to soften at around 500&deg;C" ("Twin towers steel failure" 16) 
			and that 500&deg;C is "a temperature commonly reached during building 
			fires" ("Twin towers steel failure" 16). Therefore, it is within 
			reason to assume that the temperature of the fire in the towers 
			exceeded 500&deg;C. To further investigate this point, it has been shown 
			that as the aircrafts crashed into and plowed across the buildings, 
			"they distributed jet fuel throughout the impact area to form a 
			flammable 'cloud'" (FEMA 2-21) and as this 'cloud' spread, it would 
			have ignited almost every combustible on the floors involved. This 
			mixture of jet fuel and combustibles burning along the entire floor 
			would be sufficient in creating temperatures greater than 500&deg;C.

			From investigating the normal reactions of a building exposed to 
			fire, it can be shown that as the "floor framing and supported slabs 
			above and in a fire area are heated, they expand" (FEMA 2-25). As a 
			structure expands, it can develop additional, potentially large, 
			stresses in some elements. These additional stresses could push some 
			of the load bearing columns over their strength limits causing them 
			to collapse as well. In addition, these columns would be more 
			malleable and, causing them to collapse faster than if they had not 
			been heated. Even excluding the addition stresses imbued upon the 
			columns, there are structural problems that can arise from fires. As 
			the temperature of floor slabs and support framing increases, "these 
			elements can lose rigidity and sag into catenary action. As catenary 
			action progresses, horizontal framing elements and floor slabs 
			become tensile elements" (FEMA 2-25), which can cause failure of end 
			connections [Figure Below] and allow the supported floors to 
			collapse onto the floors below.  
		</p>

		<p>	
			This buckling of the supporting columns would have been governed by 
			the "relatively weak bolted column splices between the vertically 
			stacked prefabricated exterior wall units" (FEMA 2-25) and "the 
			columns could effectively lose lateral support over several stories" 
			(FEMA 2-25) [Demonstrated by the Figure Below]".  The collapses of 
			the floors and the heat damage to the columns sufficiently explain 
			the collapse of the core columns and the subsequent chain reaction 
			which caused the destruction of the two towers. Although it is 
			important to note that "the towers would have survived if not all 
			fire insulation had been stripped" (Cherepanov 489) it has also been 
			determined, via computer simulations, that as the aircraft debris 
			went through several stories in the tower, "much of the thermal 
			insulation on the core columns would have been scoured off" ("Twin 
			towers steel failure" 16). This analysis was then verified when The 
			National Institute of Standards studied column fragments in the 
			rubble and "established that all fire insulation had been stripped" 
			(Cherepanov 489).

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proof that the core columns 
			were the first to collapse has been established from an 
			investigation of the videos that recorded that collapse. "The 
			transmission tower on top of the structure began to move downward 
			and laterally slightly before movement was evident at the exterior 
			wall" (FEMA 2-27). This suggests that collapse began with one or 
			more failures in the central core area of the building.  To complete 
			the analysis of the structural collapse an explanation as to why the 
			entire tower collapsed from an aircraft impact can be drawn from the 
			fact that "the large mass of the collapsing floors above accelerated 
			and impacted on the floors below, it caused an immediate progressive 
			series of floor failures" (FEMA 2-27), causing a domino effect that 
			accelerated as the sequence progressed.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through an analysis of load 
			distributions along the impact area, a study of the fire damage that 
			occurred immediately after impact and a explanation for the collapse 
			of the entire building, it has been shown that fire damage to the 
			core columns was the cause of the towers eventual collapse.
