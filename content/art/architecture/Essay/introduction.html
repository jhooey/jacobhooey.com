		<h2>Conceptualizing the World Trade Center</h2>
		<p>
			In understanding the World Trade Center, it's vital to study the 
			process from its origin until construction, as these factors have a 
			considerable influence upon the design of the WTC.  Political wars, 
			economical considerations, and even jealously are often factors 
			which alter the fate of a building.
		</p>
		<p>
			After World War II, the reconstruction of Europe, the abundance of 
			material and overall development lead to an increase in international 
			transatlantic trade.  A New York legislature in 1946 instigated the 
			creation of a World Trade Corporation to offer a trade center in 
			Manhattan.  New York was the home to many corporate headquarters 
			that had ties to export and imports throughout the world, so the 
			placement of a trade center there would be most beneficial.  The 
			initial plans of the building costed $140 million and would include 
			5 million square feet of space.  This project was never completed as 
			it wasn't profitable due to lack of demand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually, since the economy was growing in Lower Manhattan David 
			Rockefeller chose it as the site in 1958 for reconstruction.  He 
			"had a vision of a bustling downtown (Gillespie, page 32)" and 
			according to his organization's proposal in the only way to achieve 
			that was through infrastructure reconstruction and a World Trade 
			Center. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A basic plan of the building was soon formulated.  It was to be a 
			trade center costing $250 million sitting on 13 acres of land.  The 
			tower itself was planned to be a seventy story office building all 
			built upon " a two-story platform that would displace the 
			conventional street grid." (Cohen 14) (Figure 1)

		<p></p>
		<p>
			Port Authority, an organization picked by Rockefeller to govern the 
			building of TRC, helped modify the plan into a $355 million, 
			multiple-building project with a concourse and a plaza on 16 acresof 
			land.  This was presented to the governors of New York and New 
			Jersey, and the Mayor of New York on March 1961. (Figure 2, 
			Figure 3, Figure 4)

			Everyone gave their approval except the governor of New Jersey, 
			Robert Meyner.  He wanted the Port Authority, who specialized upon 
			transportation construction, to recover the rail system apparent in 
			New Jersey before he would give allowance to the WTC.  In the end 
			Tobin, the leader of Port Authority, despite getting the shorter end 
			of the stick, decided to take up the project.  In fact, this 
			decision greatly affected the WTC.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Tobin's staff realized that the location of Hudson and Manhattan 
			(two old office towers) that was part of the rail system was a very 
			ideal location for the trade center.  This new site had subway 
			routes better than the original site, and would connect the trade 
			center directly to New Jersey.  Furthermore, this move from east to 
			west side of lower Manhattan was in great favor to the new governor 
			of New Jersey, Hughes.  All the legislations were taken care of by 
			March 1962.
		</p>
		<p>
			Economically, it was very difficult to lease the office space out to 
			corporations.  Money was direly needed as building costs were 
			extremely high.  Yet despite the immense amount of space that would 
			be available "there simply were not enough...tenants." (Gillespie, 46) 
			In addition, the legislation rules needed "75% of tenants to either 
			be directly involved in international business or in servicing it" 
			(Gillespie, 46).  Together these two reasons gave way to Tozzoli, 
			the head of section of Port Authority in charge of WTC, to wanting 
			to build the highest building in the world.  This attraction-like 
			quality, and physical existence as a monument would attribute the 
			structure with importance, status, wealth, and allure.  Tozzoli 
			thought that to attract tenants that met criteria, "the only way...
			was to build the world's biggest project." (Guy F. Tozzoli, 
			interview with the author, New York City, 15 November 1994). 
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1964, the project's plans were announced.  It would be a $350 
			million project with ten million square feet of space, in the form 
			of "two 110-story towers that would be the tallest buildings on 
			earth. ("Biggest Building in World to Rise at Trade Center," New 
			York Times, 19 January 1964).  
		</p>
		<p>
			Many factors contributed to the conceptualization and finalization 
			of the World Trade Center.  Whether they were factors loyal to the 
			original ideas, or assimilated to the political program, more and 
			more decisions were made to snowball the size of the project, 
			ultimately resulting in the ambitious twin towers.
