		<h2>Why Attack the World Trade Center?</h2>
		<p>
			Though the architect of the original World Trade Center hoped the 
			twin towers would become a symbol of power and democracy for 
			Americans, he could not have imagined what they would represent for 
			the terrorists who destroyed the structures. For them, the World 
			Trade Center represented the control Americans held over the world 
			economy and culture (Protetch, ix). This view must have only been 
			heightened by the prominence of the Towers in New York's skyline. As 
			two of the tallest structures in New York, they were in more danger 
			of being attacked than any of the surrounding structures.
		</p>
		<h2>The 1993 Bombings</h2>
		<p>
			The events that took place on September 11 were not the first 
			terrorist attacks on the structure. Another attempt to destroy the 
			tower took place on February 26, 1993, when a car bomb was set off 
			in the parking garage under the World Trade Center. The blast filled 
			both Towers with smoke and killed six people and injured another 
			thousand. As for the damages sustained by the structure, the bomb 
			created an enormous crater in the garage and damaged the floors 
			above it. Despite the damages sustained to the base of the 
			buildings, the Towers did not collapse, which demonstrates the 
			strength and resilience of the structures.
		</p>
		<h2>The 2001 Terrorist Attacks</h2>
		<p>
			After the attacks on September 11 took place, debates ensued 
			concerning the structural implications of the collapse of the 
			towers. The first hijacked aircraft hit the North Tower at 8:46 and 
			shortly after at 9:03 a second aircraft crashed into the South 
			Tower. The towers did not immediately collapse after impact, 
			demonstrating the efficiency of the structure which was 
			(hypothetically) designed to withstand the impact of a large 
			commercial plane (Bazant 603). After almost an hour of resisting the 
			fire caused by the jet fuel, the towers collapse, damaging some of 
			the surrounding structures as they did. This delay between the 
			planes' impact and the collapse of the towers is the source of the 
			structural discussions regarding the structure. If the planes didn't 
			cause the Twin Towers to immediately collapse, then what ultimately 
			lead to their failure?
