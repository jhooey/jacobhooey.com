I like these drawings because they are raw and true to myself, they haven&#1268; been worked and reworked, some of them were even completed in 30 seconds, all of them under 5 minutes. Not enough time to think, just to react. Using such a quick paced method really gets you in the mood to draw and I know that I wouldn&#1268; of had the confidence to draw full portraits if I hadn&#1268; started small.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div> '),

The specific case that will be used for this investigation is the case of <a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/cataclysmic_variables.html">Cataclysmic Variables</a> (CVs) in which the donor star is still on (or close to) the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) at the onset of mass transfer to the white dwarf. Roche lobe geometry and angular momentum dissipation play an integral part in affecting the stability of the CV''s evolution. The CV is said to be dynamically unstable when the rate of mass transfer from the donor to the accretor increases precipitously until it exceeds the Eddington Limit. At this point, the accretion luminosity becomes greater than the Eddington luminosity and the accretor (white dwarf) cannot accrete further mass. At this point the two stars share a common envelope and most likely combine into one larger mass (this is known as a merger). We comprehensively delineate the initial conditions (mass of the donor and mass of the accretor) for which binaries are stable and unstable. We also find, for the first time, dynamical runaways which occur long after the initial phase of mass transfer <img src="/content/thesis/equation.png" />. We label this behavior as a "Latent Dynamical Instability" (LDI). The conditions for which LDIs occur have also been mapped out and are shown to be strongly correlated with the internal structure of the donor star.</p>\r\n<h4><a href="/content/thesis/Honours_Thesis.pdf">Full Thesis </a><span class="linkgreen" style="font-weight:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:italic;">(22MB pdf)</span> </h4>\r\n</div> '),

In the past year I have worked on a total of 4 websites; the <a href="http://www.jacobhooey.com/old">old version</a> of jacobhooey.com, <a href="http://www.pompouspanda.com">pompouspanda.com</a>, the current version of jacobhooey.com (built from scratch) and my current project <a href="http://www.brokenportuguese.com/">brokenportuguese.com</a>. I have a detailed article about the changes made jacobhooey.com and you can access it <a href="http://www.jacobhooey.com/index.php?action=home#2">here</a>. Most of these sites used either wordpress or joomla (with major coding overhauls) but I am proud to say that the current version of jacobhooey.com was written all by myself.

I took two course at <a href="http://www.ubishops.ca/index.html">Bishop''s University</a> (CSC111 - Programming Methodology and CSC121 - Advanced Programming Techniques) both of which specialized in coding with JAVA using the Netbeans IDE. </p>\r\n<p>The first time I used JAVA professionally was when I worked for <a href="http://www.jacobhooey.com/index.php?action=resume#3">TASKE Technologies</a> as a Quality Assurance Specialist. In this position I had to find and test bugs in their software which was written using JAVA and glassfish.\r\n</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h4>Bishop''s University</h4>\r\n<p>Bishop''s University was the first opportunity I had to apply my programming skills in a professional setting. As a <a href="http://www.jacobhooey.com/index.php?action=resume#5">Undergraduate Student Research Assistant</a> I used <a href="http://www.jacobhooey.com/index.php?action=thesis#3">FORTRAN and IDL</a> to organize and analysis data. A more detailed explanation of how this was developed can be found here.

I remember the first website I ever created; I was in 7th grade and my dad had brought home our first computer. Shortly after browsing and exploring the web I put it upon myself to start creating my own webpage.I was crude, with a solid colour background, an assortment of images I pulled from the web, and a giant beer advertisement at the top (because I used free web hosting, they got to decide the ads). Ever since then I have had a desire to understand how computers work and have always tried to find the most efficient way to get things done.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>'),

(16, 'home', 'The making of Jacobhooey.com', 2, '        <h4>The Beginning</h4>\r\n<a href="/content/history/old-site.jpg" rel="shadowbox[history]" title="The Old Site" >\r\n<img src="/content/history/old-site.jpg" class = "imgRight"/>\r\n</a>\r\n<p>It all started with WordPress. It had been a couple years since I had done any Web Design and so when I set up my hosting with BlueHost, and saw their simple script option for installing WordPress, I jumped at the chance to have my framework constructed for me. After fiddling with all the features and exploring what all the plugins had to offer I set off and explored the vast array of themes. Finally I settled on a theme called <a href="http://www.blogohblog.com/wordpress-theme-dailypress/">Daily Press</a>. From there I set out to complete the monumental task of customizing the theme to suit my particular needs. I changed the colour scheme, edited all the images, created a logo and customized the sidebar using php and html. If you want to navigate the old site here is the link: <a href="/old/">jacobhooey.com/old/</a></p>\r\n<h4>Content Creation</h4>\r\n<p>At this point I started introducing content, writing articles, uploading photos, creating pages and customizing the pages to display certain categories (this was challenging because I couldn''t find a plugin so I had to code these page templates by hand). I also dabbled in JavaScript to create <a href="http://www.jacobhooey.com/old/resume">expandable content</a> to make my resume more accessible. After I created all the content I wished to display my skills in french, so I installed the plugin <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qtranslate/">qtranslate</a>, and then translated almost all of the content on the site.</p>\r\n<h4>The Turning Point</h4>\r\n<p>At this point I realized I had strayed from my original intention for the website, which was to create a showcase of my abilities that would enhance a prospective employers experience of my resume. I had essentially create a blog with an excess of content and so I realized I needed to escape the WordPress framework or my site might always evolve back into a blog. And so began my journey of pushing the limits of my HTML and CSS knowledge as well as a learning from the ground up PHP and mySQL.</p>\r\n<a href="/content/history/WebsiteLayout.jpg" rel="shadowbox[history]" title="Design Image" >\r\n<img src="/content/history/WebsiteLayout.jpg" class = "imgLeft" />\r\n</a>\r\n<h4>New Site Design</h4>\r\n<p>This time I was determined to have a plan and to no longer explore blindly. So I fired up the old <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP image editor</a> and created a template for my new site. Then I started to collect my tools. The first was to find a nice plugin that could create the tabbed navigation I wanted. After analyzing and debating all the choices I settled on <a href="http://www.ndoherty.biz/tag/coda-slider/">Coda Slider</a> for its simplicity and the ability to customize. With this new plan and slider plugin I went about creating the index.html page and the style.css. </p>\r\n<h4>Dividing the Site Into Sections</h4>\r\n<p>I divided the site into 5 sections: Logo, Main nav, content/CodaSlider, social networking buttons and Footer. For the logo I designed it so that it wasn''t an image making it easily customizable. The main navigation was tricky, creating the "tree" layout, but with a little css margin magic I managed to make it look pretty darn good. The Coda Slider took a lot of modification, the css that was provided is no longer recognizable, but the JavaScript was left intact. The tricky part was actually the green border at the top and sometimes it still doesn''t line up with the border on the Social Network div. The social network div was added to provide people a way to like my page and I try to keep it within the realm of networks that I use. and of course I put in a nice footer that allows people to connect to my network profiles.</p>\r\n<h4>Creating a CMS</h4>\r\n<p>Once the layout was created a Content Management System (CMS) needed to be established to easily add and edit content. Luckily I found an article called <a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/cms-in-an-afternoon-php-mysql/">"Build a CMS in an Afternoon with PHP and MySQL" by Matt Doyle</a>, which gave me a great starting point. The only issue was to customize it for my needs. This is where I learned a great deal about php, mySQL and the integration between the two languages. And after a lot of hard work, I am now writing this article in a very user friendly CMS. (note: I am currently using the style.css provided by Matt Doyle, but I have plans to change it when I can find the time)</p>\r\n<a href="/content/history/cms-list-article.jpg" rel="shadowbox[history]" title="List Articles" >\r\n<img src="/content/history/cms-list-article.jpg" class="imgLeft" style = "padding-left:30px;" />\r\n</a>\r\n<a href="/content/history/cms-edit-article.jpg" rel="shadowbox[history]" title="Edit Article" >\r\n<img src="/content/history/cms-edit-article.jpg" class="imgRight" style = "padding-top:20px;padding-right:30px;" />\r\n</a>\r\n<h4 style="clear:both;">The Future</h4>\r\n<p>As you can see the site has come together fabulously and runs smoothly in most browsers. I am still working out the kinks in internet explorer and I expect that to be an ongoing project. Overall I am happy with the results and I feel great for having done created this from the ground up. It has given me much more control over my site and there is no longer any magic happening in the background that I don''t control. I hope you enjoy exploring the site and if you have any questions or comments (or job offers :) feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:info@jacobhooey.com">info@jacobhooey.com</a></p>    \r\n'),

This software used the Henyey Method to calculate <strong>the evolution of binary star systems</strong> given certain starting conditions. This software output the results in a single text file that was named using the starting conditions. The software I developed took the output data file and used the file name to <strong>organize it into sub-folders</strong> so that it could be easily found manually. The second function of my software took the output data and wrote an IDL file that would graph certain coordinates depending on our needs. <strong>Then in one step the IDL file could be compiled and 8 graphs were automatically generated with the newest data</strong>.  \r\n</p>\r\n<a href="/content/thesis/IDL/M030J040.JPG" rel="shadowbox[IDL]" title="IDL Graph 2" >\r\n<img src="/content/thesis/IDL/M030J040.JPG" style = "width:40%;float:right; padding: 10px 0 15px 20px;clear:left;" />\r\n</a>\r\n<p>Both of these functions <strong>saved hundreds of man hours</strong>, because the data used to be organized manually and the data used to be copied and pasted into SigmaPlot so a graph could be created manually. This doesn''t sound like a lot of time saved until you realize that for every data set 4-8 graphs needed to be created, and to get accurate results over 100 data sets need to be created (and some needed to be recreated). Therefore my software made it <strong>so that the 800 graphs</strong> that needed to be created in that summer alone, <strong>only 10 needed to be created manually</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately I cannot provide sample code because it is the property of Bishop''s University per the requirements of my contract.
