“You still want short bits of information, where you get to the key points quickly, but you can create a multipage, online portfolio on the Web and include case studies, a page of references, and testimonials,” she says.

It’s also a good idea to provide your résumé in several formats, including Microsoft Word, ASCII text and a PDF file, Ms. Isaacs says. “Companies have different applicant-tracking systems,” she says, “so you want to accommodate various requirements and give prospective employers the option to choose how they want to download your résumé.”



Your website should also include personal information relevant to your professional goals. Include a small bio that details interests, hobbies, awards and accomplishments. This is a good spot for a high-quality headshot photo of yourself.


You probably already have a DOC or PDF format of your resume in your job-searching arsenal. To get the most out of it, upload it to document-sharing websites such as SlideShare or Scribd.
