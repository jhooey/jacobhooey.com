##Website Description
The main purpose of the site is to improve my skills as a web developer /designer.

I tried to add a unique layout by using a "Tree" like navigation menu in the top right corner and a sliding content container using codaSlider.

This site contains a simple CMS application with a single admin page that lets you add, delete and edit articles (don't expect wordpress quality administration, its only my first project :P). 

##SQL Database Setup
To use your data base edit the config.php (in admin folder) file with your database credentials. This file also contains your username and password for the admin portal of the CMS

To create you can use the provide sql structure export database_structure.sql in the root folder.


##Special thanks to

Niall Doherty for his codaSlider, which I implemented to organize the content into sliding panels on a single page.
