##Website Description
This is my personal website. It will be used to demonstrate my skills and explain my qualifications. 

###Timeline
Version 1.0:
The first iteration of this site was created using wordpress and it was a great for collecting my content and easily integrating it into the website. I ran into trouble when trying to customize the site and realized that it would be beneficial to take complete contol of the sites development.

Version 2.0:
This version was created from scratch using php and mysql. I created my very own CMS. I configured the database, created the php to auto populate the content from the db and created the admin portal that was used to create the content. This worked well and taught me a lot about how to use php and mySQL in tandem. This version also had some of the same issues as with wordpress in that formatting the content of the page to behave exactly as required was difficult.

Version 3.0 (in dev):
This version will throw out the CMS design strategy and focus mainly on conveying my information in a concise and interesting way. Using a CMS was a fun experiment but is ultimately unecessary for the purpose of this site. Considering that this site should not be larger than 5 pages it is overkill to be using a CMS.



###Version 3.0
Expected Features:
	*index - contains a summary of all the information on the site
	*subpages - provide a detailed view of the sumarized info: each should present the info in a unique way, using graphs, photoreels...
	*modular CSS depending on screen size
	*HTML5 compliant
	*Print version on index page (print resume buttons on all pages that points to index using print CSS)
	*footer with contact info and social media links
