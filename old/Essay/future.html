		<h2>The Architectural Future of Ground Zero</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the initial shock of the 
			attacks eventually wore off, New York was presented with yet another 
			problem. What was to become of the former site of the Twin Towers? 
			This constitutes an enormous urban planning project, as sixteen acres 
			of the city has to be rebuilt and the hole in the skyline must be 
			repaired.  This problem has been approached from the point of view 
			of real estate and of architecture (Lewis). The former was concerned 
			with funding and land use. There was also a need to replace the lost 
			office space.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The architectural considerations 
			were more sensitive, as they dealt with revitalizing the city while 
			at the same time remembering the events and the victims lost on 
			September 11. It was obvious from the beginning that some sort 
			memorial would have to be present on the site. For a while, it 
			seemed that many architects weren't comfortable proposing concepts 
			other than memorials for the site (Protetch ix). It was even 
			proposed that exact duplicates of the Towers be built (Lewis). 
			However, this would have meant the loss of great architectural and 
			urban planning opportunities, and the proposals eventually began to 
			include projects which incorporated commercial, residential and 
			cultural life as well as memorials.
		</p>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, only use of the site 
			has been the Tribute in Light, a temporary memorial of searchlights. 
			The site is under the control of the Port Authority of New York and 
			New Jersey and of Larry Silverstein, the developer of the site. In 
			order to facilitate the process of planning and rebuilding Lower 
			Manhattan, the Governor and Mayor created the Lower Manhattan 
			Development Corporation to oversee the project.  There are plans to 
			build new skyscrapers, which would be accompanied by a memorial and 
			possibly a museum. The site would also undergo infrastructure 
			improvements (LMDC).
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction for one of the 
			skyscrapers, 1 World Trade Center, began in 2006 but progress is 
			slow. The design of the tower is simple and symmetrical, with steel 
			structural frame covered in clear glass and resting on a dense 
			concrete. The concrete base was designed as a security feature, to 
			guard the tower against bombings similar to that suffered by the old 
			towers. Other security measures include a protective concrete core 
			that will enclose escape staircases and fireproof elevators 
			(Frangos). The tower itself will measure 1368 feet, and will be 
			topped by a spire 408 feet high. The height and proportions of the 
			new structure are very similar to the old towers, and will evoke 
			their presence (Dunlap). However, there's still work to be done 
			before this crystalline tower and the surrounding projects become a 
			reality.
