		<h2>Structural Building Details</h2>
		<p>
			Skyscrapers are often built for fulfill the social and economical 
			needs of the population.   It's the need to "bring together people 
			and facilities for transacting business." (Ruchelman 1).  In the 
			designing of the World Trade Center, Tozolli wanted it to be "one 
			focused, centralized, and integrated facility... a city within a city" 
			(Gillespire 47).  
		</p>
		<p>
			A new architecture firm was chosen to undertake the designing of 
			this structure.  This the list they came up with in order of report: 
			1) Carson, Lundin & Shaw; 2) Philip Johnson; 3) The architects 
			Collective (T.A.C.), headed by Walter Gropius; 4) Kahn & Jacobs; 5) 
			Minoru Yamasaki Associates; 6) Welton Becket associates; and 7) Kell 
			and Gruzen.  Through elimination and comparisons, they chose Minoru 
			Yamasaki. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			The building designed were to be symbolic of its meaning: "the 
			working together in trade of the Nations of the World" (Gillespire 
			27) and therefore needed to stand for "humanity and democratic 
			purposes" (Gillespire 27). The World Trade Center was to be the 
			first thing one sees at the ocean entrance to New York, so the main 
			idea of the design was to create a "significant and expressive 
			form...[which] from far away the silhouette...[must be able to be] 
			remembered as the unequivocal image of the World Trade Center." 
			(Robins 26).  
		</p>
		<p>
			Initially Yamasaki went through a large series of models.  One was a 
			single building, and another were composed of ten smaller buildings.  
			He always returned to the same idea of two towers  surrounded by a 
			plaza.  In Yamasaki's view, he wanted spectators to be able to 
			"stand back.. and contemplate the  towers as [a] giant metal 
			sculpture" (Robins, 38). It should have excitement of its own, and 
			be "inviting, friendly, and humane" (Robins 27). (Figure 1)

		<p></p>
		<p>
			Prior to World War II, the skyscrapers had specific shapes with very 
			defined, tapering silhouettes.  After the war, the slab-high quality 
			or color of the materials, format upon the basic shapes- became 
			important.  To differentiate between other square or rectangular 
			buildings, the twin buildings became the unique design.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Empire State building, which was one of the tallest buildings 
			before the WTC, can be compared in terms of topothesia with the Twin 
			Towers.  The former's slender silhouette and its physical central 
			placement in Manhattan made it a great symbol.  Furthermore, its 
			five-story base blends in at the bottom while its top goes well with 
			the other tall buildings.  Comparatively, the twin towers with their 
			height and aesthetically appealing effect stand out as the more 
			compelling symbol.  Reflection of sunlight, light from the river, 
			and light ricocheted between the body of the towers achieved the 
			sculptural effect Yamasaki strived for.  The play of light 
			highlighted and dramatized the aesthetical appearance for observers 
			moving  from any direction toward or away the tower.
		</p>
		<p>
			The structure was built with 600,000 square feet of glass; 200,000 
			tons of structural steel; 20 mile of zinc ribbon to line foundation 
			walls, and 6 acres of marble.  
		</p>      
		<p>
			In creating the main support system of the towers, the building's 
			height was the root of the challenge.  As buildings are built taller, 
			structural components must keep it straight under its material weight, 
			while having the aptitude to brace wind loads.  They achieved a 
			successful result by utilizing the concept of load-bearing masonry 
			walls that was quite common in the world's oldest forms of 
			construction.  This wall was combined with reinforced structural 
			steel, creating an empty box with floor trusses reaching to the 
			central core.  The wind loads were channelled down the walls to the 
			foundations.  (Figure 2)

			Since the site was upon land that used to be part of the river, 
			creating an impermeable foundation was a difficult task.  They 
			solved this through an adaptation of the Milan's subway excavation.  
			They excavated the twelve block site, and poured in a slurry of 
			bentonite and water as rock and debris was simultaneously taken out.  
			Once they dug into bedrock, a reinforced steel cage is descended 
			into the pit through the slurry.  Cement was then poured in, 
			supplanting the slurry, creating the reinforced concrete wall 
			surrounding the site and keeping out the water.  They named it "the 
			bathtub." (Figure 4)

		Walls, created by the Slurry-Trench System, formed what became known as 
		"the Bathtub."  (Robins 46)

		<p>
			Yamasaki drew many inspirations from gothic architecture.  He 
			designed the windows so that from far away they would appear as if 
			"sheathed in metal" (Robins 35).  This effect was achieved through 
			using a higher column width to glass width ratio (22 inches of glass 
			between 18 inch-wide columns) compared with the usual wide panes of 
			glass.  They were in long vertical windows that have gothic arches 
			at the top.  Yamasaki decided to use stainless steel since standard 
			aluminum was very "cold-looking" (Robins 36).  In the end, a 
			materials company came up with a new alloy of aluminum to create the 
			silver alloy used for the twin towers.  (Figure 5)

		<p>
			In keeping with the spatial evenness of the appearance, building 
			necessities were hidden strategically within the building.  A 40,000 
			ton central refrigeration plant was design for the towers.  Since 
			Yamasaki didn't want optically obstructing pieces to exist, the 
			plant's pump was built inside to take water in from the nearby 
			river.  The cool water acted as air-conditioning enough to cool 
			15,000 homes.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the importance of the twin towers, the surrounding plaza 
			also be important to the architect's ideals.  The plaza's main focus 
			was to attract attention to the twin towers.  They were physically 
			detached so as to let the spectators to have the chance to walk 
			close to every side of the two towers and look up to the top.  The 
			plaza was darkly coloured compared to the tower's silvery allow 
			creating a "changing quality as one approaches across the plaza" of 
			the overall building (Robins 38).  
		</p>
		<p>
			The building process of the World Trade Center was a creative 
			progression which employed the structural aspects-height, visual 
			effect, fa&ccedil;ade - to insinuate its symbolic importance, establishing 
			its position as the center of economic trade.
