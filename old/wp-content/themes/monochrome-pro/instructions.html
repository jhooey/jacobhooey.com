<h1 class="alt">INSTALLATION</h1>
<ol>

<h1 class="alt">CONFIGURATION</h1>
<ol>
<li><b>GETTING STARTED:</b>  Monochrome creates a new administration page in the Presentation tab of your WordPress admin panel to easily manage an update the categories that you want to display on the homepage.  <a href='http://graphpaperpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/theme_options.jpg' title='Theme options page'>View the theme options page.</a>  Type in the category id's and you're ready to go! </li>
<li><b>PHOTOS:</b> Post thumbnails are managed using WordPress' Featured Image feature (WordPress 3.0 and higher).  First, be sure to setup your Settings -> Media sizes accordingly: Change the thumbnail width to 128 px wide by 128px tall.  Change the medium photo size to 575 px wide.  Save the settings.  WordPress will resize every photo uploaded to the dimensions described above when you upload the image.</li>
<li><b>YOUR AUTHORS PAGE:</b> Monochrome comes packaged with an author archive (authors.php), which will display some author specific info pulled from the Users page in your WordPress installation.  In order for the author's image to show up, you'll need to place a jpg of the author titled by the author's last name in the wp-content/themes/monochrome_pro/images/authors/ folder, sized at 75px X 75px.</li>
<li><strong>STYLES.CSS:</strong> Unlike most WordPress themes which plug all the css in one file called styles.css, Monochrome utilizes the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint</a> CSS framework to help separate positioning, typography, forms and what I'll refer to as <em>custom</em> or <em>Monochrome</em> specific styles.  To edit all <em>custom Monochrome</em> specific styles, you'll need to edit the file style.css in your wp/wp-content/themes/monochrome/ directory.</li>
