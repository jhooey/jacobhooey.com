<p>
Mass Custom Fields Manager (MCFM) is a plugin I wrote in order to help people who use WordPress to manage their post's custom fields with ease.<br>
If you don't want to spend your time editing each and every single post's custom fields to the same value or you want to delete/update specific posts you don't have another tool that let's you do that.
</p><p>
You can choose posts by category,ID,custom field value,tags (since v1.0) and more and with a click of a button manage their custom fields.<br>
You can also choose tags that if a post is saved having that tag, it will automatically get a specific custom field with a specific value (Added in v1.0).
